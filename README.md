# Unity-TinyAnim
Handle keyframe animation in Unity with percentage blended or smoothstep blended linear interpolation.

Designed for educational purposes to deliberately avoid using built-in animation classes from Unity.

There are definitely optimisations to be made in this code and I wouldn't recommend using it over the built-in classes in a production environment, but perhaps someone will learn from it.

As always, any questions are welcome.
